          <div id="article-body" class="content-body"><div id="p_outer_wrapper"><p>Derivatives of multivariate functions aren&#39;t much more complicated than those of single-variable functions.  There are three things to understand: how the idea of a derivative changes in problems of three or more dimensions, what partial derivatives are, and how to combine partial derivatives into derivatives of the function as a whole.</p>
<h4>What does the derivative of g(x,y) mean?</h4>
<p>Given a differentiable function <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script>, the phrase &quot;derivative of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script>&quot; refers unambiguously to a single function <script type="math/tex">f^{\prime}(x)</script>.  For a multivariate function like <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script>, this is not the case.  This becomes clear after comparing possible graphs of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> and <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script> side by side:</p>
<p><span id="_placeholder_0"><div class="block-diagram block-diagram-pic fig"><section class="block-diagram-title"><h5>f(x) = 4x^2+cos(x)</h5></section> <img class="block-fig-image" src="img/fig/4x2cosx.png"> <section class="block-diagram-caption"><p>Line</p></section></div></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span id="_placeholder_1"><div class="block-diagram block-diagram-pic fig"><section class="block-diagram-title"><h5>g(x,y) = 3x^2 + y^2 + 6</h5></section> <img class="block-fig-image" src="img/fig/splot.png"> <section class="block-diagram-caption"><p>Surface</p></section></div></span></p>
<p>While <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> defines a line on a two dimensional plane, <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script> defines a surface in three dimensional space.  This extra dimension explains some of the ambiguity.</p>
<p>On the two-dimensional plot, evaluating the derivative at a point <script type="math/tex">c</script> returns the slope of <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> at <script type="math/tex">x = c</script>.  Here <em>slope</em> can refer only to the ratio of change in <script type="math/tex">y</script> over change in <script type="math/tex">x</script>; no other details need to be given and, provided <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> is unaltered, no other information will change the definition or value of the slope at <script type="math/tex">x = c</script> .</p>
<p>Compare this to the surface plot of <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script>.  Given a pair of <script type="math/tex">x,y</script> coordinates <script type="math/tex">c,d</script>, what is the slope of the surface at <script type="math/tex">x=c, y=d</script> ?</p>
<p>We can&#39;t say.  As with the phrase &quot;derivative of <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script>&quot;, this question isn&#39;t detailed enough to answer.  Intuitively: if you stand at a certain point on hilly terrain, you can only define the slope at that point in terms of a certain direction.  If you decide to walk precisely due West, you can then define slope as change in elevation over horizontal unit distance along your westward path.</p>
<p>This illustrates the <em>directional derivative</em>, one of two major meanings of the derivative in 3+ dimensional space.  Given a differentiable function <script type="math/tex">h(j,k)</script>, a pair of coordinates (<script type="math/tex">p</script>, <script type="math/tex">q</script>), and a direction <script type="math/tex">d</script>, the directional derivative is the rate of change of <script type="math/tex">h</script> along the straight path from the point (<script type="math/tex">j = p, k = q</script>) in the direction of <script type="math/tex">d</script> .</p>
<p>The other major derivative in 3+ dimensional space is the <em>gradient</em> or <em>total derivative</em>, which takes a point and returns a vector with direction and magnitude equal to the steepest absolute slope at that point.   The gradient is similar to the directional derivative in that it deals with a function&#39;s rate of change in a specific direction from a specific point, but differs in that its direction at a given point is an inherent property.  In contrast, the directional derivative can be calculated in any direction from that point. (In other words: the directional derivative takes a point and a direction and returns a slope, while the gradient takes a point and returns a slope and a direction.)</p>
<p>These are useful concepts, but so far they&#39;re very abstract.  Yes, the gradient gives the direction and magnitude of the greatest change in a multivariate function&#39;s output at a point... now how do we find it?</p>
<h4>Partial Derivatives</h4>
<p>As with many areas of math, multivariate derivatives are really just an aggregate of simpler concepts.  In this case, both the gradient and the directional derivative can be found through a function&#39;s partial derivatives.</p>
<p>A partial derivative, in turn, is just a slight twist on the ordinary derivative.  Strang<span data-ref="strang1991:p477" class="bibref"><a href="#_biblio_ref_0"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span> describes the partial derivative as equivalent to the derivative of a partial function.  A partial function is a smaller piece of a multivariate function, and describes the relationship between that function&#39;s output and one of its variables while its other variables are held constant.</p>
<p>In this view, a function of two variables can also be thought of as a sequence of two functions of one variable (just like &quot;currying&quot; in Javascript and Haskell).  Using <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script> as our function, we could represent the resulting three dimensional surface as an infinite series of two dimensional functions along either the <script type="math/tex">x</script> or <script type="math/tex">y</script> axis.  To be clear, this doesn&#39;t mean that the surface itself extends into infinity: it could, or it could be bound to a range like <script type="math/tex">-10 \lt x \lt 10</script> and <script type="math/tex">-10 \lt y \lt 10</script> .  The area of the surface is irrelevant -- the sequence of two dimensional functions is still infinite in the same sense that a closed geometric object on a plane contains an infinite number of points. (This is because the real number line does not consist of discrete steps.  Given any two numbers, even very close ones such as 0.0001 and 0.0002, there are an infinite number of points between them).</p>
<p>This interpretation of partial functions and their derivatives isn&#39;t always emphasized in math classes, as the idea of functions returning functions can be more confusing than helpful in that context.  Since Javascript is all about passing functions back and forth, it&#39;s the natural approach here.</p>
<p>Before we get into any more of these abstractions, let&#39;s look at some code to describe what we&#39;ve just covered. </p>
<p>First, we define the same function g(x,y) in Javascript as <code>gFunc(x,y)</code>.  Next, we define helper functions for left and right partial application.  Their use will be explained soon.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
<span class="storage">var</span> <span class="entity function">gFunc</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(x, y) {
    <span class="comment">// g(x,y) = 3x^2 + y^2 + 6</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> (<span class="constant numeric">3</span> <span class="keyword operator">*</span> Math.<span class="function call">pow</span>(x,<span class="constant numeric">2</span>)) <span class="keyword operator">+</span> Math.<span class="function call">pow</span>(y,<span class="constant numeric">2</span>) <span class="keyword operator">+</span> <span class="constant numeric">6</span>;
}

<span class="storage">var</span> <span class="entity function">applyPartial</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(fn, leftParam) {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(rightParam) {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function call">fn</span>(leftParam, rightParam);
    }
}

<span class="storage">var</span> <span class="entity function">applyRightPartial</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(fn, rightParam) {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(leftParam) {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function call">fn</span>(leftParam, rightParam);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We described partial derivatives in terms of derivatives of partial functions earlier, and now we&#39;re using partial application in our translation to code.  This is not a coincidence.  Similar-sounding terms in computer science and math don&#39;t always refer to analogous concepts, but in this case the two ideas are closely linked.
A partial function describes the change in a multivariate function&#39;s output as one of its variables is manipulated and the others are held constant.  Partial application binds some of a function&#39;s variables and returns a function that accepts the remaining parameter(s).  If partial application is used to bind all of a function&#39;s variables but one, then the returned function reference is equivalent to the partial function of that remaining variable.  </p>
<p>More concretely: the function returned by <code>applyPartial(gFunc, 5)</code> is identical to the partial function <script type="math/tex">g_y</script> of <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script> through the plane where <script type="math/tex">x = 5</script>, and the output of <code>applyRightPartial(gFunc, 10)</code> is identical to the partial function <script type="math/tex">g_x</script> of <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script> through the plane where <script type="math/tex">y = 10</script></p>
<p>We know now that we can use partial application on <code>gFunc</code> to obtain any of its partial functions with respect to <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>.    From the previous article on differentiation of a single-variable function, we also have a general purpose <code>differentiate</code> function which returns a close approximation of the derivative of any continuous function.  This function depends on the limit definition of the derivative, which is also explained in that article.  As a refresher, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
<span class="storage">var</span> <span class="entity function">differentiate</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(fn) {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> _h <span class="keyword operator">=</span> Math.<span class="function call">pow</span>(<span class="constant numeric">2</span>,<span class="keyword operator">-</span><span class="constant numeric">20</span>);     

    <span class="storage">var</span> <span class="entity function">deriv</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">function</span>(x) {
        <span class="keyword">var</span> y1 <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="function call">fn</span>(x <span class="keyword operator">-</span> _h);
        <span class="keyword">var</span> y2 <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="function call">fn</span>(x <span class="keyword operator">+</span> _h);
        <span class="keyword">var</span> slope <span class="keyword operator">=</span> (y2 <span class="keyword operator">-</span> y1) / (<span class="constant numeric">2</span> <span class="keyword operator">*</span> _h);
        <span class="keyword">return</span> slope;
    }

    <span class="keyword">return</span> deriv;
}</code></pre>
<p>Between <code>differentiate</code> and functions for left and right partial application, we have everything needed to estimate the partial derivates of <script type="math/tex">g(x,y)</script>.  For instance, to estimate the partial derivative of <script type="math/tex">g</script> with respect to <script type="math/tex">x</script> on the plane where <script type="math/tex">y = 6</script> :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">
<span class="comment">// gFunc was defined above, </span>
<span class="comment">// and is equivalent to </span>
<span class="comment">// g(x,y) = 3x^2 + y^2 + 6</span>

console.<span class="support method">log</span>(xPDerivAtY6X3); <span class="comment">//18</span></code></pre>
<p>It can be difficult to translate the abstract concepts from calculus into working code, but once that step has been taken the implementation tends to be simple.  In finding the partial derivative we really didn&#39;t create any new functions or write much code; it just required understanding the idea well enough to interpret it in terms of the code we already have.  This will also be the case when we deal with combined derivatives of multivariate functions in a future article.</p>
