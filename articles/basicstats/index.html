<p>Like many areas of mathematics, lambda calculus has its own particular set of symbols and rules that can be intimidating at first.  But behind the Greek letters and cryptic abstractions (such as the lack of number or string literals), the core logic of the lambda calculus is elegant and simple.</p>
<p>This is an abstraction for many of the concerns in daily Javascript programming: variable binding and scope, anonymous functions, function composition, and so on.  These topics are relevant for any style of coding, and even moreso for styles making heavy use of currying and partial application.</p>
<p>In sum, lambda calculus is a field which has formally and exhaustively analyzed many of the day-to-day problems encountered in Javascript.  Because of this, its findings are important and relevant.  But as with other areas of math, there is a barrier due to differing dialects of jargon and unfamiliar symbols.  As a solution, this article presents each of the core concepts of lambda calculus in three ways: in plain English, in traditional lambda notation, and in practical Javascript code applying the concept.</p>
